<h2>0.1 Navigating</h2>

<p>There are several ways in which to navigate through ATutor.  Some of these include Breadcrumbs, Global Links, Main Navigation, Sub-Navigation, and Content Navigation.  There are also elements within content pages such as Previous and Next buttons, and Table of Contents.  The Site-Map may also be available from either the course Home page or the Main Navigation, depending on the instructor's settings.</p>

<p>Note that navigational elements described here are within the context of the Default Atutor theme.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Global Links</em> - Located at the top right, links to <em>Help</em> and <em>Search</em> are always available, as well as a link to log in or out of ATutor.  If you are logged in, a link to your Inbox (and the number of new messages in it) will also be shown.</li>

	<li><em>Main Navigation</em> - These are the topmost tabs that link to the main pages of the current area.  When in a course, the instructor can choose what course elements will be displayed here, along with the <em>Home</em> tab.</li>

	<li><em>Sub-Navigation</em> - Appears below the main navigation when there are sub-pages available for that area.</li>

	<li><em>Content Navigation</em> - </li>

</ul>

<p>Also, see the <a href="../../help/accessibility.php" target="new">accessibility page</a> located in the ATutor help section of your installation.</p>
