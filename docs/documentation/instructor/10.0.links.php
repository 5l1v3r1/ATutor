<h2>10. Links</h2>
	<p>Links to Web sites can be included with a course so course members can visit course related information on the Web. Both students and instructors can add link by using the <kbd>Suggest Link</kbd> from the Links Student Tool. Student submitted links must be approved by the instructor.
