<h2>Properties</h2>
	<p>In the properties tab, you can specify a Release Date, keywords for easier searching, and specify related topics.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Release Date</dt>
		<dd>The release date is the date in which the content will be visible to the course. You can schedule a release in the future by specifying a later date. Also, if you specify a release date that has past, it will be released immediately.</dd>

		<dt>Keywords</dt>
		<dd>Words in the Keywords are given greater emphasis during searching. Therefore they will be placed higher in a list of search results than if there were no keywords. Keywords are also used to as Learning Object Metadata.</dd>

		<dt>Related Topics</dt>
		<dd><p>For each piece of content you have in the course, you can specify what other content in the course is related. Moving content up the related topics list places that content closer to the top of the Content Navigation window. The opposite is true if you move content down the Related Topics list.</p>
		<p>You can also make content a child of another piece of content. In this case, the child content will appear as sub-content on the Content Navigation window. All sub-content children and their parent will appear in the Related Topics window.</p>
