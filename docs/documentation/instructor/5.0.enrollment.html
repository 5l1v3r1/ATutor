<a name="5.1"></a><h2>5.1 Creating, Importing, and Exporting Course Lists</h2>

<a name="5.1.1"></a><h2>5.1.1 Creating a Course List</h2>
<p>You have the option of manually generating the student list. This option is useful if you have a small number of students to add to a course, but if you have many students then the <em>Import</em> may be more beneficial. Input students manually into your course, click the <em>Create Course List</em> option.</p>

<a name="5.1.2"></a><h3>5.1.2 Creating a Course Enrollment List for Import</h2>
<p>To import a list as a file from your local system to ATutor, the enrollment list should follow the format specified by your administrator. By default, the format for the list is <kbd>"firstname", "lastname", "email"</kbd> with one student per line, but your administrator may have a different format.</p>

<p>Such lists can be easily generated by programs like a spreadsheet, or a database. Once you have the list as a file, you are ready to import it into ATutor.</p>

<a name="5.1.3"></a><h3>5.1.3 Importing Course Enrollment Lists</h2>
<p>To import a list of students into your course, you must first have a file on your local computer containing all the necessary information (<a href="#5.2.1">see  you have a course enrollment list as a file on your local system, you are ready to import it into ATutor. To import a course list, select <em>Import Course List</em> link and then <kbd>Browse</kbd>. Finally select <kbd>Import Course List</kbd> button to upload the list.</p>

<p>When importing an enrollment list, ATutor will automatically generate user names based on the firstnames and lastnames. You have the option of seperating the username using an underscore or a period. (i.e. John_Smith, or John.Smith).</p>

<a name="5.1.4"></a><h3>5.1.4 Exporting Course Enrollment Lists</h2>
<p>A course enrollment list can be exported from ATutor which is useful as a backup, or for use in other courses (through importing). You can select subsets of students to export (enrolled students, un-enrolled students, and alumni). Selecting <kbd>Export</kbd> will begin a download in your browser. The exported list is in comma-seperated format.</p>

<a name="5.2"></a><h2>5.2 Groups, Roles & Privleges</h2>
<a name="5.2.1"></a><h2>5.2.1 Groups</h2>
<p>Students can be placed into groups. This would allow the instructor to give different tests to different groups.</p>

<a name="5.2.1"></a><h2>5.2.2 Roles & Privleges</h2>
<p>Each student in your course can be assigned a role and special administrative privleges. This allows some (or all) of your students to perform actions like manage the glossary, or administer the forums.</p>
