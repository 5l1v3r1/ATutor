<h2>Tests and Surveys</h2>
	<p>The instructor, and assistants with test privileges, can create tests and surveys to be administered to enrolled students. There are a variety of options for defining tests like setting the release date, and using randomized questions or group-specific tests. Once a test or survey has been created, add questions to the Question Database, and then add these questions to the new test. </p>

	<p>Please be aware that the instructor could no long modify the anonymous option when submission has been made on a test.</p>
