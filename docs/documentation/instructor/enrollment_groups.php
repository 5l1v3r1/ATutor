<h2>Groups</h2>

<p>Under the Groups section of the Enrollment area, an instructor can create a group and add course members to it.  This allows the instructor to administer different tests to different groups. When <a href="../instructor/15.1.creating_tests_surveys.php">creating a test</a>, there is a property for assigning the test to existing groups.</p>
