<h2>7.3 Creating New Files</h2>
	<p>The <em>Create a New File</em> link will display a new interface where you can quickly create a new text or HTML file. If using Text mode, any blank lines will be saved with the file. If using HTML, you should be familiar with using HTML tags as no visual editor is provided. Selecting <code>Save</code> will save a new file with your specified information (filename and content) into the ATutor system and bring you back to the File Manager. <code>Cancel</code> will discard the file and bring you back to the File Manager.</p>
