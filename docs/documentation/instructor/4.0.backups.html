	<h1>4.0 Backups</h1>
	<p>ATutor offers the facility to create backups of your course and restore these copies at any time. This is very useful for saving revisions or give extra security for your course.</p>

	<p>To manage backups, you must be logged in as an instructor and have selected a course to backup. Under the <em>Manage</em> tab, choose the <em>Backup</em> option.

<a name="4.1"></a><h2>4.1 Creating and Restoring a Backup</h2>
<p>To create a backup of the current course, select the <em>Create</em> link from the options. Enter a description if needed and click <kbd>Create</kbd> to make a backup of the course. The backup will reside on the ATutor system and can be optionally downloaded to your local computer.</p>

<p>Once a backup has been created, you can restore it by clicking the <em>Backups</em> link, and then clicking the <kbd>Restore</kbd> button after selecting a backup to restore. Upon clicking the <kbd>Restore</kbd> button, you are given options for what material you want restored.</p>

<a name="4.2"></a><h2>4.2 Downloading and Uploading a Backup</h2>
<p>Backups can be downloaded to your local computer by selecting the backup and clicking the <kbd>Download</kbd> button. Your browser would then start a download of the backup.</p>

<p>The backup is compressed in a ZIP file. Unlike the Content Package Export feature in ATutor, the backup is not SCORM or IMS compliant.
</p>

<p>You can also upload backups from your local system to ATutor. Simply click on the <em>Upload</em> link, fill in the necessary information, and click <kbd>Upload</kbd> to finish. The backup will then appear in the list of backups.
</p>

<p>Downloading and uploading backups also allows you to exchange content from one course to another.</p>

<a name="4.3"></a><h2>4.3 Editing and Deleting a Backup</h2>
<p>Selecting a backup and clicking the <kbd>Delete</kbd> button will delete that backup. You will be asked to confirm the action before actual deletion occurs. Once a backup is deleted, it can't be restored.</p>

<p>Selecting a backup and clicking the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button will allow you to edit the description of that backup.</p>
