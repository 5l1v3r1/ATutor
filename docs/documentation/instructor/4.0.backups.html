<h2>4.0 Backups</h2>
	<p>ATutor offers the facility to create backups of your course and restore these copies at any time. This is very useful for duplicating the course or saving the entire course for safe keeping in the case of accidental loss.</p>

	<p>The Backups utility is found under the <em>Manage</em> section and is only available to Instructors.</p>

	// mention limit!

<h2>4.1 Creating and Restoring a Backup</h2>
	<p>To create a backup of the current course, use the <em>Create</em> link found from the Backups page. All created backups are securely stored remotely on the ATutor. Created backups do not count towards the course's Max Course Size quota. Once the backup is created it will be listed on the main Backups page, where it can be managed.</p>

	<p>Once a backup has been created, you can restore it by selecting the backup and using the <kbd>Restore</kbd> button. The restoration process will given options for what material you want restored.</p>

<h2>4.2 Downloading and Uploading a Backup</h2>
	<p>Backups can be downloaded to localy by selecting the backup and using the <kbd>Download</kbd> button. Locally stored backups can optionally be uploaded back into other installations of ATutor to be restored.</p>

	<p>The backup file itself is a compressed archive file in an ATutor-specific format. Backups created with ATutor cannot be used by any other system other than ATutor. Extracting the backup archive to view and change its contents is strongly discouraged as it may make the backup invalid, making it impossible to import it back into ATutor.</p>

	<p>Backups are forwards compatible, but are not backwards compatible with versions of ATutor. That is, backups will work with all future versions of ATutor, but will not work with versions of ATutor older than the version originally used to create it.</p>

<h2>4.3 Editing and Deleting a Backup</h2>
	<p>Using the <kbd>Delete</kbd> button with a selected backup will delete that backup.</p>

	<p>The <kbd>Edit</kbd> button allows you to edit the description of the selected backup. Editing a backup does not change its contents.</p>
