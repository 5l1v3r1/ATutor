	<a name="1"></a><h2>1.1 Requirements &amp; Recommendations</h2>
		<h3>Web Server</h3>
			<p>We strongly recommend Apache 1.3 as the required web server and discourage the use of Apache 2 in production environments. We believe that unless your server is running Windows, Apache 2 does not provide a significant performance improvement over Apache 1 to necessitate migration. ATutor has also been successfully installed on Microsoft IIS, but it is not part of our development testing, so we cannot make any guarantees.</p>

		<h3>PHP</h3>
			<p><acronym title="Recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, the language ATutor is written in">PHP</acronym> 4.2.0 or higher with Zlib and MySQL support enabled is also required. PHP version 4.3.0 or higher is highly recommended as it provides greater performance than previous versions. PHP version 5.0.4 or higher should be fine for non-production environments. Additionally, the following <kbd>php.ini</kbd> configuration settings are recommended, and in the case of <kbd>safe_mode = off</kbd>, required:</p>
		<pre>safe_mode               = Off
display_errors          = Off
arg_separator.input     = ";&"
register_globals        = Off
magic_quotes_gpc        = Off
magic_quotes_runtime    = Off
allow_url_fopen         = On
register_argc_argv      = Off
zlib.output_compression = On
post_max_size           = 8M
file_uploads            = On
upload_max_filesize     = 5M
session.use_trans_sid   = 0
</pre>

		<h3>MySQL</h3>
			<p>Currently ATutor only supports the MySQL database. MySQL 3.23.0 or higher, or 4.0.12 or higher is required. MySQL 4.0.20 and higher is recommended, especially if you are using languages that would benefit from being represented in the <acronym title="UCS Transformation Format, a multibyte character encoding format.">UTF-8</acronym> character set.</p>

			<p>A database user account with database creation privileges is required if your database does not already exist. That same user will then need table creation privileges as well. See the MySQL chapter <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/privileges.html">How the Privilege System Works</a> for additional information.</p>

		<h3>Web Browser</h3>
			<p>ATutor makes use of many new HTML features that are only supported in recent web browsers. Though ATutor will function effectively in older browsers we strongly recommend using the latest version of your favorite browser. We recommend <a href="http://getfirefox.com">FireFox</a> for either Windows, Unix or Mac OS X.</p>

	<a name="2"></a><h2>1.2 New Installation</h2>
		<p>Please review the <a href="#1">requirements</a> section <em>before</em> attempting to install ATutor.</p>

		<h3>Windows Considerations</h3>
			<p>windows XP user issues</p>

		<h3>Unix Considerations</h3>
			<p>To extract the ATutor package you will have to use the command <kbd>tar -zxvf ATutor-version_number.tar.gz</kbd>.</p>

			<p>Installing on a Unix machine requires some knowledge of file and directory permissions. You will be required to create a content directory and set permissions for that directory and for the <kbd>include/config.inc.php</kbd> file, so that the web server can manipulate them. The installation will not be successful if the permissions are not correctly set on that file and directory.</p>

			<p>Changing Unix file permissions from the shell prompt: <kbd>chmod a+rw filename</kbd> or <kbd>chmod a+rwx directoryname</kbd>.</p>
		
			<p>Changing Unix file permissions from an FTP client: Many FTP clients allow you to change a file's permissions. The option may be labled as "Unix Permissions", "CHMOD", or simply as "Properties" or "Attributes" and will display a window with Read, Write, and Execute checkboxes for Owner, Group, and World; checking the appropriate boxes will change that file's permissions. In our case we need the <kbd>include/config.inc.php</kbd> to be Readable and Writeable by World, and the content directory to be Readable, Writeable, and Executable by World.</p>

		<h3>Installation Procedure</h3>
			<p>download, extract (using the OS specific method), point browser to the URL. continue through the following steps:</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Terms of Use</strong><br> The usage of ATutor is
			restricted by the GNU General Public License (GPL). Your agreement with
			the GPL is required if you wish to use ATutor. See the <a href="/services/licensing.php">Licensing section</a> for more details.</li>

				<li><strong>Database</strong><br>

			ATutor requires a MySQL database to function. Enter the required
			details needed to connect to your database in Step 2 of the
			installation process. The optional Table Prefix (e.g. "AT_") option
			allows ATutor to share an existing database with other applications and
			tables. The ATutor installation script will attempt to create the
			database that is defined in Step 2, if it does not already exist. This
			requires that your MySQL user account has <strong>permission to create databases</strong>, and <strong>permission to create tables</strong>.
			If this step fails, contact your system administrator to have your
			MySQL account upgraded to allow creation of new databases, or ask your
			administrator to create the database for you. Return to the
			installation after the database has been created, or your MySQL account
			upgraded, enter the database name into the approriate field in Step 2,
			then the installation script will insert the ATutor tables.</li>

				<li><strong>Administrator Account &amp; System Preferences</strong><br>
			The Administrator account is used for managing ATutor user accounts and
			courses. The System preferences affect hosted courses and the general
			operation of ATutor.</li>

				<li><strong>Personal Account &amp; Defaults</strong><br>

			The personal account can be used to enroll into or create courses, it
			does not have any special privileges. At this step you may also choose
			to create a personal instructor account along with the basic Welcome
			course.</li>

				<li><strong>Directories</strong><br>
			Create a content directory, preferably outside your web server's
			document directory for added security, and set permissions as described
			above. On a Unix machine you will need to manually change the
			permissions on the listed files and directories in this step. No action
			is usually required on a Windows server, though in some circumstances
			Windows users may need to adjust the properties of the specified files
			and directories to make them writable. Copy the path of the directory
			into the text box provided. Ensure there are no shortcuts (Windows), or
			symbolic links (Unix) contained in the path. </li>

			<li><strong>Save configuration</strong><br>
			Before reaching the final step the include/config.inc.php file needs to
			be writable, otherwise an error will appear. Follow the instructions on
			the screen if the file permissions need to be changed</li>

			<li><strong>Submit Usage Information</strong><br>
			To assist the development team in serving the ATutor community, submit
			some basic information about the system you are running. All
			information is private. Though you are encouraged to list the location
			of your ATutor installation, you may remain anonymous by choosing not
			to submit the URL to your ATutor server during this step.</li>

				<li><strong>Done!</strong><br>
			ATutor installation has been successful and you may now log-in with
			your personal account created in Step 4, or the administrator account
			created in Step 3.</li>
			</ol>
