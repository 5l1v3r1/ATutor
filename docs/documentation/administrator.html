	<a name="1"></a><h1>1. Configuration</h1>
		<p>When you sign-in as an Administrator you will find yourself at the Configuration page. The options on this page allow you to view and manage the <a href="#2.1">Instructor Requests</a>, check for the latest version of ATutor by connecting to the atutor.ca website, or fix the content ordering.</p>

	<a name="1.1"></a><h2>1.1 My Account</h2>
		<p>My Account is where you can change your administrator account's password, real name, and email address.</p>

	<a name="1.2"></a><h2>1.2 System Preferences</h2>
		<p>All system preferences are stored in a file that must be made writeable by the web server if you want to make changes using this page.</p>

		<p>For non-Windows users: To make the preferences file writeable execute <kbd>chmod a+rwx config.inc.php</kbd> while inside the <kbd>./include/</kbd> directory in your ATutor installation.</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Site Name</dt>
			<dd>The name of the course server's website. This name will appear at the top of all the public pages, in the web browser's title bar, and as the <em>From</em> name when sending non-personal emails.</dd>

			<dt>Home <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator, a site's address">URL</acronym></dt>
			<dd>This will be the web address for the 'Home' link in the public area. Leave empty to remove this link.</dd>

			<dt>Default Language</dt>
			<dd>The default language to use if the client's browser settings cannot be detected. Must be one of the languages already installed. See the <a href="#1.3">Languages</a> section on installing and managing existing languages.</dd>

			<dt>Contact Email</dt>
			<dd>The email that will be used as the return address when needed and when instructor account requests are made.</dd>

			<dt>Maximum File Size</dt>
			<dd>Maximum allowable file size in Bytes that can be uploaded to the course's File Manager. This does not override the value set for <kbd>upload_max_filesize</kbd> in <kbd>php.ini</kbd>.</dd>

			<dt>Maximum Course Size</dt>
			<dd>Total maximum allowable course size in Bytes. This is the total amount of space a course's File Manager can use.</dd>

			<dt>Maximum Course Float</dt>
			<dd>How much a course can be over its <em>Maximum Course Size</em> limit while still allowing a file to upload or import. Makes the course limit actually be <em>Max Course Size</em> + <em>Max Course Float</em>. When <em>Max Course Float</em> is reached, no more uploads will be allowed for that course until files are deleted and the course's space usage falls under the Maximum Course Size.</dd>

			<dt>Authenticate Against A Master Student List</dt>
			<dd>Whether or not to enable Master Student List authentication. If enabled, only new accounts that validate against the master list will be created. See the <a href="#2.2">Master Student List</a> section for additional details on using this feature.</dd>

			<dt>Require Email Confirmation Upon Registration</dt>
			<dd>If enabled requires email confirmation in order to sign-in. As new accounts are created an email is sent with instructions on how to confirm their account. The user will not be allowed to sign-in until after they confirm their account.</dd>

			<dt>Allow Instructor Requests</dt>
			<dd>If enabled will allow students to request upgrades to instructor accounts. Instructor account requests must then be approved by using the <a href="#2.1">Instructor Requests</a> section.</dd>

			<dt>Instructor Request Email Notification</dt>
			<dd>If enabled, and if <em>Allow Instructor Requests</em> is enabled, then an email message will be sent to the <em>Contact Email</em> notifying them each time a new instructor account request is made. This does not affect whether or not instructor requests can be made, only whether or not a notification message is sent out each time.</dd>

			<dt>Auto Approve Instructor Requests</dt>
			<dd>If <em>Allow Instructor Requests</em> is enabled then existing students requesting instructor accounts will be upgraded automatically, bypassing the approval process. Additionally, any newly created accounts will be created as instructors rather than as students.</dd>

			<dt>Theme Specific Categories</dt>
			<dd>Theme specific categories allows for the association between themes and categories. Courses belonging to a specific category will always be presented using that category's associated theme. This option disables the personalised theme preference. Use the <a href="#3.3">Categories</a> section to create and manage course categories, and the <a href="#1.4">Themes</a> section to install and manage themes.</dd>

			<dt>Illegal File Extensions</dt>
			<dd>A list of all the file types, by extension, that are not allowed to be stored on the server. Any file that is being imported or uploaded whose extension is in the specified list will be ignored and not saved. The list must contain only the file extensions seperated by commas without the leading dot.</dd>

			<dt>Cache Directory</dt>
			<dd>Where the cached data should be stored. On a Windows machine the path should look like <kbd>C:\Windows\temp\</kbd>, while on Unix it should look like <kbd>/tmp/cache/</kbd>. Leave empty to disable caching.</dd>

	<a name="1.3"></a><h2>1.3 Languages</h2>
		<p>ATutor can be displayed in more than a dozen languages! Only completly translated languages are made available as packages from the atutor.ca website.</p>

	<a name="1.3.1"></a><h3>1.3.1 Importing Languages</h3>
		<p>Language packs can be imported either manually by retreiving the package and then importing it into ATutor, or automatically by having ATutor connect to the atutor.ca language repository directly.</p>

		<p>To <em>manually</em> import a new language pack:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Visit <a href="http://atutor.ca/atutor/translate/index.php">atutor.ca/atutor/translate/</a> to download one of the available language packs for your version.</li>
			<li>Use the <code>Browse...</code> button to find the downloaded language pack.</li>
			<li>Use the <code>Import</code> button to import the language.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>If your ATutor installation is connected to the Internet and can contact the atutor.ca website then it will try to retrieve the list remotely. If it cannot retrieve the list a message indicating so will be presented rather than a drop down list, in that case you will have to use the manual method described above. To automatically import a new language pack from within ATutor:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Select the language you want to import from the drop down.</li>
			<li>Use the <code>Import</code> button to import the selected language.</li>
		</ol>

	<a name="1.3.2"></a><h3>1.3.2 Managing Existing Languages</h3>
		<p>Installed languages can be deleted or exported as an ATutor language pack for redistribution. You cannot delete the default language as specified by the <a href="#1.2">System Preferences</a> <em>Default Language</em> option.</p>

		<p>See the section on <a href="#1.3.3">Translating ATutor</a> below for details on how to edit, or create a new language that isn't already available as a language pack.</p>

	<a name="1.3.3"></a><h3>1.3.3 Translating ATutor</h3>
		<p>You can customize your installation's language or assist the ATutor project by translating from within ATutor. For official documentation on translating see the <a href="http://atutor.ca/atutor/docs/translate.php">atutor.ca/atutor/docs/translate.php</a>.</p>

	<a name="1.4"></a><h2>1.4 Themes</h2>
		<p>Themes are used for changing the look and feel of an ATutor installation. Themes can be set as a personal preference or forced upon using the <a href="#1.2">System Preferences</a> <em>Theme Specific Categories</em> option.</p>

		<p>ATutor's architecture allows for the seperation of presentation elements from code or logic elements. As a result, it is easy for any <acronym title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language, the web's structured language">XHTML</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets, the web's presentation layer">CSS</acronym> proficient person to create customized themes and layouts without having to know anything about <acronym title="Recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, the language ATutor is written in">PHP</acronym> or the inner workings of ATutor itself.</p>

	<a name="2"></a><h1>2. Users</h1>
		<p>The Users section allows the managing of students, instructors, and administrators. Please note that administrators are not considered real users of the system as they cannot create or view courses. For the purposes of documentation the term "users" will be reserved for any account type that is <em>not</em> an administrator.</p>

		<p>There are four types of user accounts that can exist in an ATutor installation, as defined by their Status:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Disabled</dt>
			<dd>Only administrators may disable an account. Disabled accounts cannot sign-in to your ATutor installation, but may still appear as enrolled in courses.</dd>

			<dt>Unconfirmed</dt>
			<dd>Unconfirmed accounts are created only when the <a href="#1.2">System Preferences</a> <em>Require Email Confirmation Upon Registration</em> option is enabled.</dd>

			<dt>Student</dt>
			<dd>A regular account which can enroll, but not create courses.</dd>

			<dt>Instructor</dt>
			<dd>A regular account which can enroll as well as create courses.</dd>
		</dl>

	<a name="2.1"></a><h2>2.1 Instructor Requests</h2>
		<p>If the <a href="#1.2">System Preferences</a> <em>Allow Instructor Requests</em> option is enabled and the <em>Auto Approve Instructor Requests</em> option is disabled then pending instructor account requests will be listed on this page.</p>

		<p>Using the <code>Deny</code> or <code>Approve</code> buttons after selecting an entry will remove it from the list and take the appropriate action. An email message will be sent to the account holder notifying them of the change.</p>

		<p>Tip: The number of pending instructor account requests is always listed on the main <a href="#1">Configuration</a> page.</p>

	<a name="2.2"></a><h2>2.2 Master Student List</h2>
		<p>If the <a href="#1.2">System Preferences</a> <em>Authenticate Against A Master Student List</em> option is enabled then this page will allow you to manage that list. If enabled, only new account submissions that validate against the master list will be created. The master list is flexible and can be used to validate any two fields, one of which is publicly viewable to Administrators, while the other is hidden. A common use of this feature would be to authenticate students using a previously assigned Student ID &amp; PIN combination.</p>

		<p>Once an account is authenticated and created--and confirmed if <em>Require Email Confirmation Upon Registration</em> is enabled--then that user will be associated with the appropriate entry in the Master Student List. Viewing the Master Student List shows Student ID-Username pairs.</p>

		<p>Student IDs in the Master Student List that are not associated with any student account are considered to not have been created.</p>

	<a name="2.2.1"></a><h3>2.2.1 Importing Student IDs</h3>
		<p>Importing Student IDs into the Master Student List requires a specifically formatted file:</p>

		<p>The master list must be a plain text file, where each row in the file contains two fields seperated by a single comma. The fields may optionally be enclosed by double quotes. Such a file is known as a <acronym title="Comma Separated Values">CSV</acronym> file and can be generated manually using a text editor, or by any spreadsheet application (such as MS Excel). The first field will be used as the Student ID. The second field will be the PIN or Password, which will be encoded in such a way that cannot be viewed and read by anyone. Those two fields together will be used to authenticate students when creating new accounts.</p>

	<a name="2.3"></a><h2>2.3 Email Users</h2>
		<p>The Email Users feature allows an administrator to send an email to all students, instructors, or both. Unconfirmed and Disabled accounts are not included in the mailing.</p>

	<a name="2.4"></a><h2>2.4 Administrators</h2>
		<p>An ATutor installation can be maintained by multiple administrators each with their own privilege access level. The three kinds of administrator accounts are described below.</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Super Administrator</dt>
			<dd>This administrator has no restrictions and has access to all of the administrator options. This is the only administrator type that can create and delete other administrator accounts. There must always be atleast one Super Administrator account.</dd>

			<dt>Active Administrator</dt>
			<dd>An administrator account whose access is limited. This administrator only has privileged access to sections that they were assigned to when their account was created by the Super Administrator.</dd>

			<dt>Inactive Administrator</dt>
			<dd>An addministrator account who has not been assigned any access privileges. As a result, this administrator cannot sign-in.</dd>
