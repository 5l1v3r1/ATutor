<h2>4.1 Backups</h2>
	<p>A course backup includes all available course material as an archive in a format specific to ATutor. Backups are forwards compatible with future versions of ATutor but may not be backwards compatible with previous versions of ATutor. Once a backup is created it can be downloaded for safe-keeping, imported into another ATutor installation, used as the basis for a newly created course, and available in the originating course's Backup Manager. Instructor can also create their own course backups from within a course.</p>
