	<a name="1"></a><h2>4.1 Backups</h2>
		<p>A course backup includes all available material as an archive in a format specific to ATutor. Backups are forwards compatible with future versions of ATutor but are not backwards compatible with previous versions of ATutor. Once a backup is created it can be downloaded for safe-keeping, imported into another ATutor installation, used as the basis for a newly created course, and available in the originating course's Backup Manager.</p>

		<a name="1.1"></a><h3>4.1.1 Creating Backups</h3>
			<p>The number of backups a single course can keep on the server is defined by the <a href="#1.2">System Preferences</a> <em>Course Backups</em> option.</p>
			<p>Administrators can create backups for any course, while instructors can only create backups of courses they own.</p>

		<a name="1.2"></a><h3>4.1.2 Restoring Backups</h3>
			<p>Restoring a backup as administrator is the same as when restoring a backup as an instructor, with the added option of being able to select which course the backup should be restored into.</p>

			<p>For details additional details on restoring a backup into a course see the Backup Manager's <a href="../instructor.html#4.2">Restoring Backups</a> section in the Instructor Documentation.</p>
