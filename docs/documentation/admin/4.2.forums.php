<h2>4.2 Forums</h2>
	<p>This section allows an administrator to create course specific forums as well as cross-course shared forums. A shared forum is viewable from any of the courses that it is shared with. Only administrators can create shared forums, though instructors or privileged course members in any of the courses sharing a forum can manage messages in those forums.</p>
