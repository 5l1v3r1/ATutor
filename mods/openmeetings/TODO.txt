------------
- allow admin to change the room size.
- clean room after course is deleted.
- though these would be way easier to do it in the openmeeting's end
- upgrade nusoup script
- update readme, and write up something that teaches the user to setup red5
- allow 2 modes

------------
- Allow each group to have their own meeting, anyone in the group can start off the meeting, and when all exit, room should be deleted.
- Course meeting should be triggered by instructor only.  Otherwise page should display the meeting time (There is no meeting at the moment.  THe next available meeting is at xxxx)
- Instructor should probably be capable to adjust their own meeting size in their own config.
- Research on how recorded video works, see if we can remove meetings as well.
- admin/openmeetings, check if there is a slash at the end.
