* Installation process:
1. Check files/folder priviledge: 
   If the write priviledge is not given to the script on the files/folders that will be modified or overwritten, a message will be prompted to grant priviledge
2. Compare files with SVN
   The files that are to be modified or overwritten will be compared with ATutor SVN, if the local copy of user's file is customized, a warning will be prompted to let user decide if they want to proceed with installation. If yes is chosen, the user has to take responsibility that the installation may break their customization.
3. Backup files
   The files that are modified or overwritten during the installation will have a backup on the original copy. At the end of the installation, the list of all the backup files are displayed. Users are strongly recommended to fully test ATutor after the patch installation. If users are not happy with the result, they can always revert back the old ATutor by copying back the backup files. If users are happy with the result, it's also recommended to remove the backup files since they occupy hard disk space.
