Certificate module is used to define tests' certificates by instructor. Students can view or print the certificates via "Certificate" link. This module includes one default certificate PDF template at module content folder as part of the module, that an ATutor system administrator can replace it via FTP.

Please note that if test property "Release Results" is defined as "Do not release results", students would not be able to see this test's certificates listed in student "Certificate" page.

How to use your own default certificate:
In your certificate pdf file, the text fields are created in the pdf file to display customized texts. Once the pdf file is ready, the names and default values of the text fields need to be defined in a text file called "default_certificate.pdf.fields", so that the certificate module knows the relationship between the text fields in pdf and their default values. Please refer to "default_certificate.pdf" and "default_certificate.pdf.fields" for example.
 
In example "default_certificate.pdf.fields", you will see, if a text fields with name "full_name" is defined in pdf and it's supposed to have default value [FNAME] [LNAME], in "default_certificate.pdf.fields", please have a section like:
 
---
FieldName: full_name
FieldValue: [FNAME] [LNAME]

Please keep "FieldName: ", "FieldValue: " unchanged.
