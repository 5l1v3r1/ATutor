5. From the default Administration home page, click 'Install Modules'.
6. From the list of modules, click the radio button next to the module named 'Photo Album'.

Administration

The system is set up so that both administrator and instructor can approve and delete photos. When moderation is enabled, a student adds a photo it is sent to an approval queue until an instructor or an administrator approves it. To approve photos, select Photo Album from the Manage tab and view the New Photos. Click the check box and then click the appropriate button to approve photos.

The moderation setting is disabled by default, so you need to enable it using the Manage | Photo Album | Enable Moderation
