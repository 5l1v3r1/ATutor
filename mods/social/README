Shindig test for Windows

CONFIG
-------------
PHP Exptension needed (php.ini):
- curl
- openssl
- all gadgets require SHINDIG.

PARTUZA
-----------
Then install partuza
change asp_tags in php.ini


TODOs:
------------
- Profile needs work
- Format and styles
- Paginator
- Language, instead of 'Friends', maybe we should use 'Contacts'?
	- Otherwise it has to be broken down into coworkers, collegues, etc.
- Implements the relationships into the friends.inc.php
- sort by most active for connection
	- show contact that we may know
- mutual friends
- generate a list of "friends that you may know"
- take out app
- progress meter for profile (dynamic) [as in ie.40% profile done.]
- Google ads
- need another 'group' table?
	- join groups, invite, etc, discussion, news, articles
	- just forums. everything in here. shares the atutor forums
- A lot of the fields inside the ATutorService, Shindig's Person interface has not been implemented into the ATutorService class.
  These fields such as, books, accounts, sports, quotes, moves, etc. can be added later depends on the needs.
- OAuth service
- Change the <table> to <div> for training_and_education and credits_and_work_experience under sprofile.tmpl.php
- need to shorten the list of connections and activities, add "more..." to it.  
- need more filters for search under connection
- PHP 4.3.0 for ATutor requirement, cannot use __construct (5.0 only)
- job search
- CMSMadeSimple single logon
- IMPORTANT: 
	For every new user/ or existing user, add an entry to the privacy table, default it to 11111 for everything. 
	So then the precondition = everyone before social module will have a privacy setting
- Fix the AT_friends relationship, needs to implement this into the confirm friends section. For now, manually add it to the DB.
- friends search needs to implement the resultset restrictions
- search privacy control needs imporovement, all friends should be able to search them out, meaning if relationship = 1, then privacy control->disable()
- limit the memory a user can use for applications (either a total or as per)
- Clean up at_activities after [duration] or [amount of activities]
- [03.17.2009] Group invite.php, check if "I" have already invited this person, if so disable checkbox.
- [03.17.2009] Group invite.php, maybe allow search on existing member?
- [03.17.2009] Group invite.php, implements flashy, dynamic, web2.0 search, livesearch=http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_livesearch.asp
- [03.17.2009] fix .htaccess on groups/index.php problem
- [03.17.2009] Implements 'Leave Group', 'Edit Group', 'Disband Group'.
- [03.17.2009] Approve/Reject groups invitation, functions built but needs the interface.
- [03.18.2009] Maybe mouse over list and show a box of description, not sure about accessibility though...
- [03.18.2009] Groups search, with filters. Do we need filters? Like do we need to search by category? I would think not. Just title suffices?
- [03.19.2009] Fix all broken links, lots of links are dummy links.
- [03.19.2009] support Logo upload
- [03.19.2009] Message board needs to be implemented, on social group page.
- [03.23.2009] Namespace all tables to "social_"
- [03.23.2009] Find friends and Add friends should be separated.

Jan 13, 2009
------------
- Implement Social Network into ATutor.  This includes setting up new tables, and new pages.
- I have decided to implement this via a module.  Better modualirty and extendibility.  

Hardships: 
- URL rewrite with mods.  This is gonna give me some problems that I didn't have time to test back then when i was developing url_rewrite.  Now is a good time to fix those problems as well.


Due:
- End of January -.-"


Jan 14, 2009
------------
Questions: 
- Should I add relationship table for the future? Right now I am using just a table...
	- obviously...
	- instead of using the relationship tables that I had in my notebook.  Use constants, for i18n language purposes.


Jan 15, 2009
------------
- Only records the 'good' things.
- There is a bug in add friends.  It list people that are not my friends as friends.
- Change "friends" to "contact", boss wants it to be linkedin style, not facebook style.  The more linkedin it is, the more merrier.
- Add friends picture/name should be clickable to their profile.

Jan 19, 2009
------------
- "My Friend" sql fixed
- added Approval and Rejection.
- Removal okay.
- Activities message errors.
- Okay, So Shindig is the server that consists of all the JS.  Basically, that means, it is "The container".  And it is open source =D
- Meaning, I only need to implement RESTFUL and RPC API

PROBLEMS:
- **Slow profile picture loading, don't know why.

QUESTIONS:
- Should we consider the MVC Model?

Jan 22, 2009
------------
- Need a bit more research.  Shindig actually has the social library built in.
- Need to build a bridge to connect stuff to it, or any other server.
- It serves as a gadget server 


Jan 27, 2009
------------
- Javascript running now within ATutor content page, need to set up the set() function
	- which means we also need to get the hash key-value function setup


Jan 28, 2009
------------
- Successfully created a request to the server with the library and security token.
- Need to work on retrieving data back. 
- problem, google chrome is stopping all my "unsafe activities"....
- need to work on the prefs string.
- remember to add the container.js and a bunch others library in order for it to work, ask cindy if there are easy ways to add them in


Jan 29, 2009
------------
- implement add applications.
- then reorganize the application and savant template codes
- then, sigh, worry about the Shindig container thing.

Jan 30, 2009
------------
- create a constant file inside the mod.
- implement view param

Feb 2, 2009
-----------
- Build a graph for the network.  The one with the most edges = most popular
- Add all the person entries to a new table, why, 3NF, so far we will add the following:
	- *at_member_position
	- *at_member_education
	- *at_member_websites
	- *at_member_additional_information
- Need to think about groups as well

- As well, located a bug for Login -> Course, ib flag took out the session.


Feb 3, 2009
-----------
- QUESTIONS
- Timeline/time diagram problem.  Should we display all activities before the time that the friend is approved? Or afterwards? If so, a timestamp is needed for the friend table.
- Display Applications --> "My Applicatoins" and "Show all availble applications"?  Instructor levels applications?  Anyone can store informations? How big should it be? Max applications per person?
- i18n problems with this.
- be able to validate the user = session id before doing any edition.  Users should not be able to see others by altering POST and GET variables.
- *too slow on social profile page, there are too many queries running.

Feb 12, 2009
------------
- Fixed the slow issue on the social profile page.

- QUESTIONS
- How much user data can we store?  As in, the application data, how many application can a user have/ how many applicatoin data can be stored into our db?
- Social profile and user profile.  Creates extreme confusion... we only want one, what is the possible/feasible way to implement a module, and change the profile page?
	- invovles changing the template of the user profile.  Affects all themes? 

Feb 17, 2009
------------
- Contact needs work, need to find the functionality of things.
- Prepare questions for the upcoming meeting w/ Greg, need to discuss several things for Opensocial to happen.
	- Openid and Oauth, research on those.
- Privacy issue, visibility issue


Feb 18, 2009
------------
- How do we limit application? Can anyone install any application?
- I am gonna use this color theme: http://colorschemedesigner.com/#1T11TdteJw0Lt
- Fixed the load time from get_profile_image, use the method defined in vitals.
- Look into the spandict gadget to see how similar gadgets can be installed.


*- Redesign searchFriends.
- Provide REST/RPC support so then other client can grab our friends? Need to provide OAuth then?...oh god.


Feb 19, 2009
------------
- container.js has been changed? inside atutor/jscript/opensocial
- lots of clean up for this folder as well
- bulid a social graph maybe?
- search contact/connection works perfectly now.
- gadget fails, check if it does provide REST
- working on ATutor REST services 

Feb 23, 2009
------------
- http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/docs/dataapis.html
- Implemented \lib\Shindig\ATutorDbFetcher.php, \lib\Shindig\ATutorService.php
	- a bunch of GET, DELETE, CREATE services based on the Opensocial spec, which the interface are defined in Shindig /src/
- A brief explaination on how this works (gadget that needs service):
	- Web browser -> send requests to gagdets?ifr to load the gadget, this is handled by the iframe thing which i have in the Application.class.php
	- Shindig receives the request and found out that this gadget requires member_id's friends list, and recognize this is a service request
	- Sends out JSON format _POST value to ATutor service, ATutor service calls up ATutorDbFetcher to fetch info from the tables, returns via JSON
	- Shindig recevied data and sends it back to gadget.
	- Gadget parse these data and display it with javascript.
- Lots of the Requests are being handled within the Javascript itself, which in our case, container.js for now.
- Moved JS library from /jscript/ to /lib/js/


Feb 25, 2009
------------
- Fans feature for artist? sounds interesting
- allow the storage of demo

MILESTONE:
- Get all the API RESTful and services ready
- Then move on to privacy control

Mar 04, 2009
------------
- privacy control classes implemented on profile.
- added a SetPrivacyControl.php to create temp user.
- Altered Shindig class to adapt the tag SPI. Check shindig tag's repository shindig/php/src/social/spi/
- Only the Activities has been changed, for some reasons the activity_ids param is missing.  I am keeping the original function callers anyway.

Mar 09, 2009
------------
- search is not functioning.  
  SQL 
	SELECT * FROM at_members m where
	first_name like "%a%" OR
	last_name like "%a%" OR
	email like "%a%"
  returns 83 entries
  where a search on "a" will only returns 21.
  - Privacy control which doesn't do anything at the moment returns 13.
   .........WTH
	*- Side note, I fixed the query and then all the entries are back, just don't do any search in [friends x members]

Mar 10, 2009
-------------
- fixed search
- fixed search with friends
- fixed markFriends
- added privacy control over search
- fixed PrivacyObject default constructor
- adjusted css to greg's suggestion, will stop using module.css
- Check Features ontop for 


Mar 12, 2009
-------------
- designed the simple UML for group in my notebook.


Mar 13, 2009
-------------
- Potentially security holes inside all social.tmpl.php, cuz they use $_POST
	- fix: use savant assign even for post, and escape XSS injection


Mar 17, 2009
------------
- Lots of TODO, check above.
- invitation works.
- list "My Groups", "Recently Joined"
- Functions for acception/rejecting/removing groups invitation is done inside friends.inc.php.
	- Though, need interface to work with this.
- Needs to implement Leave Group, Edit Group, Disband Group
- Build a blog/wall kinda thing?


Mar 18, 2009
------------
- done invitation Accept/reject
- done Edit
- done leave group
- brief info on "my groups"

- BUG: leave group shows cached group info, either reassign variable or find a better way for this.


Mar 19, 2009
------------
- got search working, sort by "weight", weight is defined by the # of times the search phrase appears inside the result
- got livesearch working
	- Find a way to disable the input suggestion from browsers.  Can do this by generation a random # for the input name attribute, 
	  so then it will not be cached.
	- done.
- Now, i guess it's a good time to link to group forum...? sigh


Mar 20, 2009
------------
- Message board implemented, need to do error/feedback messages though.
- jquery.all.js ==> 

Class.create is not a function
- [Break on this error] var Container = Class.create();
  container.js (line 1)
- element.dispatchEvent is not a function
  [Break on this error] element.dispatchEvent(event);


Mar 23, 2009
------------
- validate group before going into view.php.  ie. if group is deleted.
