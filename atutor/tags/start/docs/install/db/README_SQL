If you are creating a new install of ATutor, run the atutor_schema.sql
Example:
>mysql -u username -p atutor < atutor_schema.sql

To upgrade ATutor run the corresponding atutor_upgrade_FROM_VER_to_TO_VER.sql file. If upgrading up from more than the previous 
version then apply each upgrade in series until the latest version is achieved.

Examples:

If you are upgrading from ATutor version 1.1 to version 1.2, run atutor_upgrade_1.1_to_1.2.sql

If you are upgrading from ATutor Version 1.0 to Version 1.2, run atutor_upgrade_1.0_to_1.1.sql first, then run atutor_upgrade_1.1_to_1.2.sql
